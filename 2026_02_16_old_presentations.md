## Old presentations

Many years ago I have dumped presentations from my talks on Slideshare. I mostly forgot about this, but once I looked at the URL, I discovered they insert ads between slides, making the reading uncomfortable.  I'm not against ad-based monetization in principle,  if it allows keeping the site up,  but seeing a coffeemaker between *each* slide of presentations about distributed computing ….

So, yesterday I spent a few hours in nostalgia:  finding sources for my presentations and put them online on GitHub: https://github.com/rssh/presentations
Funny to read one's own description of programming language evolution from 2016 and understanding that, despite the huge progress, not so many things have significantly changed.
